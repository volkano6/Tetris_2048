  <h1> TETRÄ°S 2048</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
  <p>Tetris and 2048 are two games that have maintained their popularity
    since their first release. These two games have algorithmic similarities.
    Hence, we combined these two games called "Tetris 2048" in Python using
    the stddraw library. This report aims to demonstrate the methods
    utilized to create the game, explain them in detail, and show the
    accomplishments that this project has provided.
  </p>
  <h3> DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT </h3>
  <p>The goal of this project is to integrate two games:
    Tetris, founded in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov, Dmitry Pavlovsky,
    and Vadim Gerasimov, and 2048, created by Gabriele Cirulli.
    The game is similar to Tetris in that the player can move and
    rotate 7 different shapes on the 2D playing surface, each consisting
    of four square tiles. The distinction is that tetrominoes have numbers
    on their tiles, and the number on each tile determines their color.
    Each approaching tetromino is made up of four tiles numbered 2 or 4 at
    random.</p>
